Uses of Python:

A.Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
B.Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
C.Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
D.Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
E.Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

Advantages of Python:

1)Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
2)Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
3)Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
4)Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
5)Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

Indentation in Python:

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
