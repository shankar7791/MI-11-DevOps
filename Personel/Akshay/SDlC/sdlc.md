The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is a framework that development teams use to produce high-quality software in a systematic and cost-effective way. The SDLC methodology is used by both large and small software organizations. These teams follow development models ranging from agile to lean to waterfall and others.

The software development lifecycle gives organizations a methodical, step-by-step approach to developing successful software. From gathering the initial requirements for a new product, through maintaining a mature product on the market, we’ll teach you how to employ SDLC.

Phase 1: Plan
The first stage of new software development will be to gather all relevant information from stakeholders and analyze this information to determine what will be feasible.

This includes compiling requirements, studying user personas, and agreeing on the product’s purpose. During this phase, the team will also discuss the opportunities and risks of pursuing the project. This is why Software Testing Help refers to this phase as both requirements gathering and analysis.

Phase 2: Design
After the team has agreed on a broad set of requirements and goals for the product, the next step will be to create a design specification. This should answer the question, “How will we build this?”

For a product team, this phase would include determining the priority order of the proposed work, building a product roadmap, and obtaining stakeholder agreement on it. This will help everyone on both the development and product teams get a clearer picture of what they are aiming for.

Phase 3: Implement (or Code)
This is the stage where the engineering team actually codes the product. At this stage, the development team translates the high-level overview communicated in the roadmap into a tactical set of assignments, due dates, and day-to-day work schedules.

Phase 4: Test
After the team has completed a version of the software, they will release it to a testing environment. Here, the QA team and the developers will test all areas of the application to spot any defects, bugs, or other problems.

Phase 5: Deploy
At this stage, the team is confident it has fixed all defects and that the software has been built to the agreed-upon goals and specifications.

Now it’s time to release the software to the production environment. This means the product will be generally available for customers to buy and use.

Phase 6: Maintain
With the software now live and being used by customers, the development team’s focus will shift to maintaining it.

The developers will need to be ready to address requests for enhancements, bug fixes, and new features. These requests will come from many sources—sales, executives, customers—but the product management team will determine which of these initiatives make it onto the product roadmap for developers to work on.
