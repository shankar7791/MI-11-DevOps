1) What is GIT?
=> GIT is a free & open source distributed version control system designed to handle everyhing from small to very large projects with speed & efficiency.
2) What is a repository in GIT?
=> A repository contains a directory named .git, where git keeps all of its metadata for the repository. The content of the .git directory are private to git.
3) What is the command you can use to write a commit message?
=> git commit -m “message”
4) What is the difference between GIT and SVN?

               GIT stored content as metadata.
     SVN : It’s a centralized version control system.
                SVN is revision control.
                SVN does not have a clone repository.
                SVN stores content as file.
5) What are the advantages of using GIT?
=> a) Performance
     b) High availability
     c) Security
     d) Flexibility
     e) Collaboration friendly
     f) wide Acceptance
6) What language is used in GIT?
=> GIT is fast, and ‘C’ language makes this possible by reducing the overhead of runtimes associated with higher languages.
7) What is the function of ‘GIT PUSH’ in GIT?
=> ‘GIT PUSH’ updates remote refs along with associated objects.
8) Why GIT better than Subversion?
=> GIT is an open source version control system; it will allow you to run ‘versions’ of a project, which show the changes that were made to the code overtime also it allows you keep the backtrack if necessary and undo those changes. Multiple developers can checkout, and upload changes and each change can then be attributed to a specific developer.


9) What is “Staging Area” or “Index” in GIT? 
=> Before completing the commits, it can be formatted and reviewed in an intermediate area known as ‘Staging Area’ or ‘Index’.

12) How will you know in GIT if a branch has been already merged into master?
=> Git branch - merged lists the branches that have been merged into the current branch
Git branch -no merged lists the branches that have not been merged
13) What is the function of git clone?
=> The git clone command creates a copy of an existing Git repository. 
14) What is the function of ‘git config’?
=> The ‘git config’ command is a convenient way to set configuration options for your Git installation. 
15) What does commit object contain?
=> a) A set of files, representing the state of a project at a given point of time
b) Reference to parent commit objects
16) How can you create a repository in Git?
=> In Git, to create a repository, create a directory for the project if it does not exist, and then run command “git init”. By running this command .git directory will be created in the project directory, the directory does not need to be empty.
17) What is ‘head’ in git and how many heads can be created in a repository?
=> A ‘head’ is simply a reference to a commit object. 
18) What is the purpose of branching in GIT?
=> The purpose of branching in GIT is that you can create your own branch and jump between those branches. 


19) What is the common branching pattern in GIT?
=> The common way of creating branch in GIT is to maintain one as “Main”
20) How can you bring a new feature in the main branch?
=> To bring a new feature in the main branch, you can use a command “git merge” or “git pull command”.
21) What is a ‘conflict’ in git?
=> A ‘conflict’ arises when the commit that has to be merged has some change in one place, and the current commit also has a change at the same place. Git will not be able to predict which change should take precedence.
22) How can conflict in git resolved?
=> To resolve the conflict in git, edit the files to fix the conflicting changes and then add the resolved files by running “git add” after that to commit the repaired merge, run “git commit”. Git remembers that you are in the middle of a merger, so it sets the parents of the commit correctly.
23) To delete a branch what is the command that is used?
=> Once your development branch is merged into the main branch, you don’t need
development branch. To delete a branch use, the command “git branch –d [head]”.
24) what is another option for merging in git?
=>

25) What is GIT version control?

28) What is the difference between the ‘git diff ’and ‘git status’?

=> A ‘git checkout’ command is used to update directories or specific files in your working tree with those from another branch without merging it in the whole branch.
30) What is the function of ‘git rm’?

=> Commit message is a feature of git which appears when you commit a change. Git provides you a text editor where you can enter the modifications made in commits.
36) Name a few Git repository hosting services
=>  Pikacode , Visual Studio Online , GitHub , GitEnterprise , SourceForge.net
