Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:
   * web development (server-side),
   * software development,
   * mathematics,
   * system scripting 
   
Data Types in Python:
Built-in Data Types: String, Integer, Float, Complex, List, Tuple, Dictionary, Boolean

Operators in Python:
1.Arithmetic operators 
2.Assignment operators 
3.Comparison operators 
4.Logical operators
 5.Bitwise operators

Why to Learn Python?
=>  Python is a high level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable.

Python is Interpreted - 
	Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need o compile your program before executing it.

Python is Interactive -
	You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.

Python is Object-Oriented -
	Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

Python is a Beginner's Language -
	 Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games. 
	
Characteristics of Python :

Following are important characteristics of Python Programming :

   - It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.
   - It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.
   - It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.
   - It supports automatic garbage collection.
   - It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.
   

Python Features
Python's features include −

    Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
    Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes. 
    Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.
    A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.
    Interactive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.
    Portable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.
    Extendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.
    Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
    GUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.
    Scalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.
